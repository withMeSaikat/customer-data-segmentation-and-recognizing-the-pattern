# customer-data-segmentation-and-recognizing-the-pattern
In this project, the pattern of mall visiting customers have been explored to find most profitable groups of people.

## Technologies Use:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- SciPy
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset Used:
> The open dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Objectives:
1. To conduct EDA on the dataset,
2. Find how various charactristics of the customers are correlated with the spending score,
3. Observing the dependency of spending score and other parameters, find the most important features of the data to do cluster analysis,
4. To segment the customers into different clusters by finding important parameters,
5. Groping the clusters or segments of customers into various categories of different importance.

`Note:` The results, observations and conclusions can be found in the notebook file.
